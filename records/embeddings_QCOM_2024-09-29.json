CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology. CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of cellular connections today. OFDMA-based. OFDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency band and time by allocating different subcarriers to individual users. 5G heavily leverages OFDMA-based technologies, while most of the OFDMA-based technologies deployed prior to 2020 are classified as 4G technology. The 4G specifications were defined within 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), a global organization that develops technical specifications, including the specification of the radio component (LTE) and the core network component (Enhanced Packet Core or EPC). 3GPP has been developing the 5G system through the specification of the radio component (NR) and the core network component (5G Core or 5GC). Unlike 4G that has fixed Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) parameterization, 5G has multiple OFDM parameterizations to address a wide range of spectrum and use cases.

Any of the above could negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows. Although we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, some of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the manufacture, assembly and testing of products for their other customers (including our competitors) while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture, assemble or test our products, and such capacity may be limited based on our suppliers\u2019 ability and willingness to invest in the capital required to manufacture in the leading process technologies. Our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may also manufacture their own integrated circuits that compete with our products. Such suppliers have in the past allocated and may again allocate raw materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce or limit the production of our products. To the extent we do obtain long-term capacity commitments, we may incur additional costs related to those commitments or make non-refundable payments for capacity commitments that are not used. Further, certain of our suppliers have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to unilaterally reduce their capacity commitments to us.

To the extent we are unable to obtain adequate supply to meet our delivery obligations, we may be obligated to make payments to our customers for such shortfalls. From time to time, the global semiconductor industry experiences demand for integrated circuits that exceeds the industry\u2019s capacity to meet that demand. Our ability to meet increased demand for our products has been in the past and may in the future be limited due to the inability to obtain the additional manufacturing, assembly and test capacity necessary to fully meet such demand. If we are unable to fully meet customer demand, this could result in lost sales opportunities, reduced revenue growth and harm to our customer relationships. These issues may be exacerbated if customers overstate their expected demand requirements in order to procure additional supply, which could negatively impact our ability to forecast and to allocate supply appropriately among our customers. The above issues may also be exacerbated with respect to our platform solutions, which already entail a great deal of complexity due to differing lead-times, technologies and suppliers for each integrated circuit product included in such solutions.

This was primarily driven by the adverse impact of the requirement to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures for federal income tax purposes, our payment of $1.0 billion related to certain previously postponed U.S. federal income tax payments from fiscal 2023 and an installment payment for a one-time U.S. repatriation tax accrued in fiscal 2018 of $414 million. Net changes in our operating assets and liabilities positively impacted our operating cash flows in fiscal 2024 primarily from an increase in accrued customer incentives, which included the impact of timing of related payments, and an increase in accounts payable due to timing and amount of inventory purchases, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues. Debt. At September 29, 2024, we had $15.0 billion of principal fixed-rate notes outstanding, $1.4 billion of which matures in May 2025. The remaining debt has maturity dates in 2027 through 2053. We have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $4.5 billion of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At September 29, 2024, we had no amounts of commercial paper outstanding."}}

At September 29, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to issue new debt in the future.

At September 29, 2024, our remaining future payments were $1.0 billion for a one-time U.S. repatriation tax accrued in fiscal 2018, after application of certain tax credits, which is payable in installments over the next two years. At September 29, 2024, other current liabilities included $530 million for the next installment due in January 2025. Beginning in fiscal 2023, for federal income tax purposes, we are required to capitalize and amortize domestic research and development expenditures over five years and foreign research and development expenditures over fifteen years (such expenditures were previously deducted as incurred). As a result, our cash flows from operations are adversely affected due to significantly higher cash tax payments. However, the adverse cash flow impact will diminish in future years as capitalized research and\ndevelopment expenditures continue to amortize.

Our stock repurchase programs are subject to periodic evaluations to determine when and if repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders, and we may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue repurchases at any time. On October 16, 2024, we announced a cash dividend of $0.85 per share on our common stock, payable on December 19, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 5, 2024.

In fiscal 2024 and 2023, there were no significant impairment losses or adjustments to our previous judgments and estimates recorded. Inventories. We measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering judgments and estimates related to future customer demand and other market conditions, such as the impact of the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2023, which negatively impacted consumer demand for smartphones and other devices that incorporate our products and technologies. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, any significant changes in customer demand that are less favorable than our previous estimates may require additional inventory write-downs and would be reflected in cost of sales resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. For fiscal 2024 and 2023, the net effect from changes in this estimate and related reserves was less than 2% of cost of revenues during each period. Impairment of Goodwill, Other Indefinite-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets. We monitor our goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets for the existence of impairment indicators and apply judgments in the valuation methods and underlying assumptions utilized in such assessments.
