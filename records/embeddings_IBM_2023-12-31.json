Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients\u2019 digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world\u2019s leading research organizations.

The company\u2019s financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers\u2019 businesses; for example, certain of the company\u2019s services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity may impact the company\u2019s financial results in any particular period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company\u2019s financial results are difficult to predict.
