We remain committed to our goal of delivering five technology nodes in four years to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. This year, we achieved several key milestones on our product roadmap, including: \u25aaWe launched the Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra processors, featuring our first integrated neural processing unit, for power-efficient AI acceleration and local inference on the PC.\u25aaWe introduced the 13th Gen Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 mobile processor family, led by the launch of the first 24-core processor for laptops, and introduced the new Intel vPro\u00ae Platform powered by the full lineup of 13th Gen Intel Core processors.\u25aaWe introduced the 14th Gen Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 desktop processor family, delivering fast desktop frequencies and enhanced desktop experience for enthusiasts.\u25aaWe launched the 4th Gen Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable processors, a critical part of our heterogeneous hardware and software portfolio to accelerate real-world data center, cloud and edge workloads, including AI, and also launched the 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors with Intel\u00ae vRAN Boost, a new general-purpose chip that fully integrates Layer 1 acceleration into the Xeon SoC and is designed to eliminate the need for external accelerator cards.\u25aaWe launched the 5th Gen Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable processors for data center, cloud, and edge, with embedded capabilities for powering AI workloads.\u25aaWe introduced two new Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 Pro Graphics Processing Units, Intel Arc Pro A60 and Intel Pro A60M, and shipped Intel Arc Pro A40-based systems. Investing in leading-edge, at-scale manufacturingWe are committed to strengthening the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain for leading-edge semiconductor products by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. In the US, we are expanding our existing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, and investing in two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio. We have submitted all four of our major project proposals in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, estimated to represent over $100 billion of US manufacturing and research investments over the next five years, to the US Department of Commerce's CHIPS Program Office.In the European Union and Israel, we have announced a series of investments, spanning our existing operations in Ireland and Israel, as well as our planned investment of more than $33 billion in Germany to build a leading-edge wafer fabrication mega-site, and our plans to invest up to $4.6 billion in an assembly and test facility in Poland. We also announced the start of high-volume manufacturing using Intel 4 technology and EUV technology in Ireland.Unlocking valueWe continue to look for innovative ways to unlock value for our stakeholders. We sold a 32.4% minority stake in our IMS Nanofabrication business, including investments from Bain Capital and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Net proceeds resulting from the IMS minority stake sales totaled $1.4 billion. We also executed a secondary offering of Mobileye stock that generated net proceeds of $1.6 billion. Further, we communicated our intent to operate our Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) as a standalone business, with standalone financial reporting beginning January 1, 2024. This is expected to enable potential private and public equity investments. These transactions provide an additional source of capital to support the critical investments needed to advance our strategy. Fundamentals of Our Business6",

Over the past decade, we have taken actions to integrate diversity and inclusion expectations into our culture, performance and management systems, leadership expectations, and annual bonus metrics. Through our annual employee inclusion survey, employees can voice their experiences at Intel and provide feedback on how we can continue to improve. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we believe we can achieve more, including beyond the walls of Intel. Our RISE strategy and 2030 goals set our global ambitions for the rest of the decade, including, in part, ambitious goals to achieve 25% representation of women in senior leadership; achieve 12% representation of underrepresented minorities in US senior leadership; achieve 10% representation of employees with a disability in our global workforce; and exceed 40% representation of women in technical roles, including engineering positions and other roles with technical job requirements. Our ambitious goals were established, in part, based on modeling of where market availability is expected to be in 2030. Market availability analysis will be re-conducted over the time period to assess ongoing alignment and expectations. To drive accountability, we continue to link a portion of our executive and employee compensation to diversity and inclusion metrics. We have committed our scale, expertise, and reach through our comprehensive RISE strategy to work with customers and other stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of inclusive business practices across industries. As part of the Alliance for Global Inclusion, we worked with a coalition of technology companies to create a global inclusion index survey, which serves as a benchmark for companies to track diversity and inclusion improvements, provide information on current best practices, and highlight opportunities to improve outcomes across industries. The results of the third global inclusion index survey were published in 2023 and shared with business leaders across industries. For the first time, based on the maturity of the respondents' best practices, the survey results transitioned to an index, in which organizations that received an overall score of 50% or higher across all regions in which they participated were recognized for their diversity and inclusion efforts. There were 27 respondents and, of those, 18 earned spots on the index, including Intel. This collective effort allows the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to advance progress on closing persistent gaps and advancing more inclusive practices in workplaces, industry, and society. The survey shows increased commitment to diversity and inclusion around key areas of workforce inclusivity, recruitment, advancement opportunities, and accountability. We will also continue to collaborate on initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry, advance social equity, make technology fully inclusive, and expand digital readiness for millions of people around the world.2 Senior leadership refers to salary grades 10+ and equivalent grades.

As part of the Alliance for Global Inclusion, we worked with a coalition of technology companies to create a global inclusion index survey, which serves as a benchmark for companies to track diversity and inclusion improvements, provide information on current best practices, and highlight opportunities to improve outcomes across industries. The results of the third global inclusion index survey were published in 2023 and shared with business leaders across industries. For the first time, based on the maturity of the respondents' best practices, the survey results transitioned to an index, in which organizations that received an overall score of 50% or higher across all regions in which they participated were recognized for their diversity and inclusion efforts. There were 27 respondents and, of those, 18 earned spots on the index, including Intel. This collective effort allows the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to advance progress on closing persistent gaps and advancing more inclusive practices in workplaces, industry, and society. The survey shows increased commitment to diversity and inclusion around key areas of workforce inclusivity, recruitment, advancement opportunities, and accountability. We will also continue to collaborate on initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry, advance social equity, make technology fully inclusive, and expand digital readiness for millions of people around the world.2 Senior leadership refers to salary grades 10+ and equivalent grades.

      "In 2023, the automotive industry grew with an approximately 9% increase in global vehicle production year over year. We expect industry ADAS volumes to grow faster than overall global vehicle production in the coming years and anticipate long-term ADAS growth from increases in the percentage of vehicles that are equipped with basic ADAS features from the factory. Despite our expectation for a decline in Mobileye ADAS volumes in 2024 due to a correction of inventory with our customers, we continue to believe we will benefit from positive industry ADAS growth over the medium-term. In addition to potential volume growth, our portfolio of advanced solutions has the potential to drive higher average system price over time.",

As of December 30, 2023, our capital investments classified as construction in progress totaled $43.4 billion ($36.7 billion as of December 31, 2022). These assets have not yet been placed into service and have not yet begun depreciating. As these construction-in-progress assets are placed into service, we expect to incur depreciation expense that impacts future production costs and, ultimately, cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to grow our revenues to offset these production costs, our gross margin and operating income will be unfavorably affected. Additionally, we could incur asset impairments on property, plant, and equipment assets if our IDM 2.0 strategy is not successful.",

      "Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we estimate total depreciation expense in 2023 was reduced by $4.2 billion. We estimate this change resulted in an approximately $2.5 billion increase to gross margin, $400 million decrease in R&D expenses, and $1.3 billion decrease in ending inventory values. These estimates are based on the assets in use and under construction as of the beginning of 2023 and are calculated at that point in time. Most of the depreciation expense associated with this useful life change is included in overhead cost pools and is combined with other costs and other depreciation expense from assets placed into service after this calculation was performed, for which such costs are subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. As a result, the actual amount of impact from the useful life change that is included in our 2023 operating results and financial position is impractical to individually and specifically quantify on a year-over-year basis.",

Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.Share-based compensationShare-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans.We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments provide better comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model, how management currently evaluates core operational performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including in comparison to other peer companies.",

      "We have limited experience in the highly competitive and capital-intensive third-party foundry business. As we pursue our strategy to establish IFS as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, we will face intense competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries (GF), United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). To succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; multi-chip packaging; system integration; manufacturing capacity; price; margin; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Building and maintaining a competitive foundry business requires high ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. Moreover, many of the largest potential IFS customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality information, intellectual property, and foundry capacity, among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain.",

      "To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies. We incurred R&D expenses of $16.0 billion in 2023, $17.5 billion in 2022, and $15.2 billion in 2021. We are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, AI, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our then 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors and adverse impacts to our financial condition as a result of higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utilization of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.",

In recent years, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utilizing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV photolithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in our incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term.

To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver or demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. We could also be required to write off inventory or record excess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. As we continue to make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, these underutilization risks may be heightened.

We experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our then 7nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. In 2022, Intel's 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor was delayed to allow for more platform and product validation time. These delays have allowed competitors using third-party foundries, such as TSMC, to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us, including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. Because of these prior delays in our process technologies, we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products.",

      "Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications). Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs, adversely affect our gross margins, and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and warranty our products.",

We have entered new businesses and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by growth in semiconductor demand, ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud to edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, and silicon photonics. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we announced plans to establish IFS as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through updates to our processes, systems, and guardrails between our manufacturing and our individual product-based business units. The implementation of our internal foundry operating model requires many internal structural, system, and process changes to support the separation of the product and manufacturing sides of our business and our external foundry business, including a new ERP system. In parallel, we are undertaking significant efforts to separate out portions of our business, such as PSG and IMS, to raise capital and unlock value as we focus on our core product and manufacturing capabilities. Significant business changes are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2022, we wound down Intel Optane; in 2020, we agreed to sell our NAND memory business to SK hynix; and in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those businesses.",

      "In particular, geopolitical and trade tensions between the US and China, one of our largest markets, have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. Further, the US has imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. Specifically, in 2022 the US significantly increased US export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and on artificial intelligence and advanced computing products. In 2023, the US added to the restrictions in all three areas and also worked with Japan and the Netherlands to align on additional restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. During this time, the US has increasingly added Chinese companies to prohibited lists. In response, China has restricted US access to certain minerals and has blocked certain companies that provide products to Taiwan's military from selling products in China. These restrictions have in some instances reduced our sales and in a number of instances required specific governmental authorizations or exceptions - $3.2 billion, or 6%, of our 2023 revenue was dependent upon US government export control authorizations, an amount that we expect may increase in future years. These and potential future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance and result in reputational harm to us.

Changes in employment-related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock price or lower stock price performance relative to our competitors have been reducing the retention value of our share-based awards, which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation.

      "The failure or inability by us or our customers and suppliers to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, including with respect to the materials and processes we are permitted to use and as to air quality and wastewater requirements, may impede our ability to manufacture products or expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, cease the use of a particular material or process, remove or remediate hazardous substances, or incur other expenses or liabilities. Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements. For example, semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions. New or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional abatement equipment, purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter, where feasible, our production processes and sources. In addition, new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities. Regulations in response to human health concerns may also limit or prohibit the use of a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are found in parts, components, process chemicals and other materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. Such chemicals are critical to the manufacturing and functioning of many semiconductor products and there are limited technically and commercially feasible alternatives to them.

      "Inventory ValuationDescription of the MatterThe Company's net inventory totaled $11.1 billion as of December 30, 2023, representing 5.8% of total assets. As explained in \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the consolidated financial statements, the Company computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable quality. Auditing management\u2019s assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the determination of excess and obsolete inventory reserves and lower of cost or net realizable value is judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls over the costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory, and the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices.Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product demand forecasts, costs and selling prices) of the underlying data used in management\u2019s inventory valuation assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory valuation adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions.",

Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.",

For PSUs granted in 2023 and 2022, the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting at the end of the three-year performance period will range from 0% to 200% of the target grant amount.

TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. For 2023 PSUs, overall payout will be capped at target grant amount if our absolute TSR is negative.

      "Under the 2006 Plan, we may grant RSUs and stock options. We grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market condition, performance condition, and a service condition, which we call PSUs. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and employees. For PSUs granted in 2023 and 2022, the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting at the end of the three-year performance period will range from 0% to 200% of the target grant amount. The PSU payout will be determined based on our performance (i) relative to annual targets for each year in the performance period with respect to a revenue growth metric, weighted 60%, and a cash flow from operations metric, weighted 40%, which results are then averaged at the end of the three-year performance period; and (ii) as may be adjusted by two equally weighted modifiers: the TSR of our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of above median of the S&P 500 Index over a three-year period and revenue CAGR for the three-year performance period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. For 2023 PSUs, overall payout will be capped at target grant amount if our absolute TSR is negative. As of December 30, 2023, 16 million PSUs were outstanding. PSUs vest three years and one month following the start of the performance period.

The Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI had been awarded $1.5 billion, but vacated the damages award and will send the case back to the trial court for further damages proceedings on that patent. The Federal Circuit also ruled that Intel can advance the defense that it is licensed to VLSI\u2019s patents.
